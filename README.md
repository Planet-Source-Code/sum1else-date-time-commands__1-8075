Believe it or not, some people don't know about these simple codes. Well, here they are. Also, they are all documented in the VB help file
if returning the time constantly it is wise to use a timer to do it so you always have the current time or date
date commands:
(date)'returns the current date
day(date) ' gets the current day
month(date) ' gets the current month
year(date) ' gets the current year
datediff 'gets the distance between two dates
time commands:
second(time) 'returns the current second
minute(time) 'returns the current minute
hour(time) 'returns the current hour
(time) ' returns the current time
```
